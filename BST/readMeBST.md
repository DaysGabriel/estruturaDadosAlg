## BST (Binary Search Tree)

This directory aims in implementing two versions of BST, which are:

1. Recursive BST
2. Iteractive BST

Each implementation, is going to have a version with and without the use of templates, without counting the various types of ways the methods are going to be implemented.

So, as you can see, by making this repository, my objective is to learn how a single data structure, in this case, a BST can have multiple implementations.
